# VerletIntegration
Basic demo of Verlet Integration using SDL2 and OpenGL3. This was a small personal project to learn C++, SDL2, OpenGL, and how to use tools like Make.

## Build

### Mac OS
Simply run `make` in main directory.

### Other systems
For other systems, I haven't tested, but I think all you need to do is place your own SDL2 library file and opengl driver in the Lib folder and run `make`. Or modify the makefile to include the search path for these files.
